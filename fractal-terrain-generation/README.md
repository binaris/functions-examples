# Procedural voxel-based terrain engine (powered by Binaris functions)

Demo originally created for talk given by Ryland Goldstein at _Serverless conf 2018_ in San Francisco.


1. If you haven't run `bn login` before, do so
1. Run `npm run install_deps`
1. Run `npm run deploy`
1. Navigate to the generated Binaris function URL for `servePage` in your browser

For even faster generation consider upgrading to the Binaris paid tier.

If you made changes to the frontend (anything in `src`) simply run `npm run deploy_frontend`

For backend changes run `npm run deploy_backend`
